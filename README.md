# World_Weather_Analysis

Using our knowledge of Python, and using Google maps API. We are going to creat a travel scenario or itineray based of the weather preferences filled by our testers, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map. 

See below pictures from one tester preference where the tempature is between 75 and 90 degrees.
